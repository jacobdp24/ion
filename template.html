<p><font color='#FFF'> Hey everyone!</font></p>
<p><font color='#FFF'> Hope your Winter Break was refreshing! We will resume our meetings this Thursday, January 15th at 7pm in Torrey Pines Center South. 
	This is right across the street from the Village at UCSD, and right next to the Sanford Consortium! Information Technology Services (ITS) have granted 
	us some conference rooms/office space to hold our meetings. The buildings were recently renovated to enable student collaboration and we are truly thrilled and thankful to 
	be one of the first to utilize it! Once you reach the building the door entrace to the main plaza will be right in front of the shuttle stops, from there make your way to 
	the third floor (you will only need to go up a single floor), and walk down an open hallway to one of the doors (northwest or northeast entrance). We will be there to let you in!
	Signs will be placed to help guide you so you don't get lost :).</font></p>
